### Assessment Criteria 

For the first sprint, the assessment criteria are not stringent. Groups can earn the maximum points by **making a 10-12-minute group presentation** and **submitting the required deliverables** to GitHub.

Bonus points can be earned if:
- The product backlog is generated according to the DEEP principle.
- User stories are based on the INVEST principle.
- The use of [Retrospective templates](https://agilebox.app/blog/4ls-retrospective/)

----

### Considerations

- When working with Figma, consider saving a local copy of the Figma file.
  - *You can save a local copy of a file in the .fig (Figma Design), .jam (FigJam), or .deck (Figma Slides) formats: `File > Save local copy `*
- Utilize [Trello](https://trello.com/) to organize user stories and manage the product backlog.
- Consider using LLM e.g ChatGPT for:
  - Generating user stories and evaluating them in alignment with the **INVEST** principle
  - Constructing a product backlog and Assessing tasks with respect to the **DEEP** principle
