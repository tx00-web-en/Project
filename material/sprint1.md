2. Project description:
   - The title of the project
   - The names of the members
   - The target users and other stakeholders
   - The main functionality of the application.
   - Describe the user stories and Product backlog: You might consider using [Trello](https://trello.com/)

   - Sprint Review
   - Retrospective
   - More on [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/what-is-scrum/)
4. Make sure to include each member’s contributions to this sprint.
5. Presentation: Here’s a [template for a 10-12-minute presentation](./ppt-template1.md) to help you structure your content effectively.

> When a group presents their sprint, two other groups will be assigned to ask questions and engage with the presentation.

### Assessment Criteria 

For the first sprint, the assessment criteria are not stringent. Groups can earn the maximum points by **making a 10-12-minute group presentation** and **submitting the required deliverables** to GitHub.

Bonus points can be earned if:
- The product backlog is generated according to the DEEP principle.
- User stories are based on the INVEST principle.
- The use of [Retrospective templates](https://agilebox.app/blog/4ls-retrospective/)

----

### Considerations

- When working with Figma, consider saving a local copy of the Figma file.
  - *You can save a local copy of a file in the .fig (Figma Design), .jam (FigJam), or .deck (Figma Slides) formats: `File > Save local copy `*
- Utilize [Trello](https://trello.com/) to organize user stories and manage the product backlog.
- Consider using LLM e.g ChatGPT for:
  - Generating user stories and evaluating them in alignment with the **INVEST** principle
  - Constructing a product backlog and Assessing tasks with respect to the **DEEP** principle

### Project Ideas

> **If you don’t already have a project idea**, you can consider one of the following MERN fullstack + AI‑powered applications.  
> These are **examples to inspire your group** — you may use one as‑is, adapt it, or take it in a completely new direction.

#### Detailed Ideas

- [Note‑taking Web App](./ideas/note.md)
- [AI‑Powered Blogging Platform](./ideas/blog.md)
- [E‑commerce Store with Admin Dashboard](./ideas/e-commerce.md)
- [URL Shortening API Landing Page](./ideas/url.md)
- [Bookmarks](./ideas/bookmarks.md)
- [E‑Learning Platform](./ideas/e-learning.md)
- [A cloud‑based storage and collaboration](./ideas/fylo.md)
- [ Job Listings with Filtering](./ideas/jobs.md)

#### Additional Brainstorming Ideas

- **AI-Powered Task Management App**: Build a **MERN fullstack task management system** where users can register, log in, and manage tasks (CRUD + deadlines + completion tracking). Integrate an **LLM API** to allow natural language task creation (e.g., “Remind me to finish homework tomorrow at 5 PM”) and provide AI-generated task prioritization or daily summaries.

- **AI-Powered Social Media Clone**: Build a **MERN fullstack social platform** (mini Twitter/Instagram) with posts, likes, comments, follows, and profiles. Use an **LLM API** for AI-generated captions/hashtags, smart feed ranking (semantic similarity), and content moderation.

- **AI Personal Finance Tracker**: Implement a **MERN app** where users log income and expenses with visualizations. Add **LLM API integration** to automatically categorize spending from descriptions, explain monthly financial trends in plain English, and generate savings tips.

- **AI Recipe Sharing & Cooking Assistant**: Create a **MERN recipe-sharing platform** where users post and search recipes. Extend it with an **LLM API** so users can input available ingredients (“I have rice, eggs, and spinach”) and receive AI-generated recipes, substitution suggestions, and nutrition summaries.

- **AI Language Learning Tutor**: Create a **MERN language learning platform** with vocab practice, flashcards, and progress tracking. Use an **LLM API** to provide conversational practice with an AI tutor, personalized quizzes, and grammar/writing feedback.
