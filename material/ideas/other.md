## Additional Brainstorming Ideas

- **AI-Powered Task Management App**: Build a **MERN fullstack task management system** where users can register, log in, and manage tasks (CRUD + deadlines + completion tracking). Integrate an **LLM API** to allow natural language task creation (e.g., “Remind me to finish homework tomorrow at 5 PM”) and provide AI-generated task prioritization or daily summaries.

- **AI-Powered Social Media Clone**: Build a **MERN fullstack social platform** (mini Twitter/Instagram) with posts, likes, comments, follows, and profiles. Use an **LLM API** for AI-generated captions/hashtags, smart feed ranking (semantic similarity), and content moderation.

- **AI Personal Finance Tracker**: Implement a **MERN app** where users log income and expenses with visualizations. Add **LLM API integration** to automatically categorize spending from descriptions, explain monthly financial trends in plain English, and generate savings tips.

- **AI Recipe Sharing & Cooking Assistant**: Create a **MERN recipe-sharing platform** where users post and search recipes. Extend it with an **LLM API** so users can input available ingredients (“I have rice, eggs, and spinach”) and receive AI-generated recipes, substitution suggestions, and nutrition summaries.

- **AI Language Learning Tutor**: Create a **MERN language learning platform** with vocab practice, flashcards, and progress tracking. Use an **LLM API** to provide conversational practice with an AI tutor, personalized quizzes, and grammar/writing feedback.
