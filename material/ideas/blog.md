# AI‑Powered Blogging Platform

> [!NOTE]  
> Note: The following project is provided as a suggested starting point. Your group may choose to use it as‑is, adapt and extend it, or take inspiration from it to create something entirely new. It is meant to support your brainstorming process, not to limit your creativity.


### About the Project

This project is based on the [Blogr Landing Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP) from Frontend Mentor. The original challenge provides a clean, professional landing page design for a fictional blogging company. You will adapt this layout and extend it into a **full‑stack MERN application** that goes beyond static design by incorporating **AI‑powered blogging features**.

---

### Business Goals

- Deliver a **modern blogging platform** where users can create, edit, and publish articles.  
- Provide **AI‑enhanced features** such as:  
  - Article suggestions based on user interests  
  - Optimized keywords for better visibility  
  - Smart summaries of long posts  
- Support both **end‑users** (who write and read blogs) and **administrators** (who manage users, content, and system health).  

---

### Target Users

1. **Writers and bloggers** who want to create and publish content easily.  
2. **Readers** who want to discover and consume optimized, summarized articles.  
3. **Administrators** who manage user accounts, moderate content, and oversee platform performance.  

---

### Development Phases (aligned with sprints)

- **Sprint 1**: Create a **Figma prototype** and write **user stories**. See [course materials](https://github.com/tx00-web-en/Project/blob/main/material/sprint1.md) for detailed deliverables.
- **Sprint 2**: Build the **UI** (adapting the Blogr layout) and implement **basic backend functionality** such as user authentication and article CRUD operations.  
- **Sprint 3**: Add **user administration**, integrate **LLM features** (summaries, keyword optimization, suggestions), and perform **testing**.

### You Don’t Start from Scratch

To reduce stress around UI design, you are not expected to design everything yourself. Instead, you can **adapt the provided layout**:

- Challenge link: [Blogr Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP)  

> You may look at existing solutions for inspiration, but you must **clearly document** what you reused and what you modified. You will also need to extend the layout with additional views (e.g., article editor, dashboard) and an **LLM interface**, so your final product will go beyond the starter design.

---

### How This Can Be Used as a Full‑Stack Project

Although the Blogr challenge begins as a static landing page, you will transform it into a **full‑stack MERN blogging platform** by adding functionality such as:

- **User accounts and authentication** (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js)  
- **Article management** (create, edit, delete, publish, archive)  
- **LLM integration**:  
  - Generate AI‑based summaries of blog posts  
  - Suggest optimized keywords for SEO  
  - Recommend related articles to readers  
- **Admin dashboard** for managing users, moderating content, and viewing analytics  

---

### Workload Distribution

To ensure balanced contributions, each group should assign roles clearly e.g **One or two members** focusing on **UI/UX** (adapting the layout, ensuring usability). This includes **Figma prototyping** in Sprint 1.  

This division ensures that design, prototyping, and technical implementation all progress in parallel.
