# Note‑taking Web App

> [!NOTE]  
> Note: The following project is provided as a suggested starting point. Your group may choose to use it as‑is, adapt and extend it, or take inspiration from it to create something entirely new. It is meant to support your brainstorming process, not to limit your creativity.

### About the Project

The Note‑taking Web App is a **digital productivity tool** designed to help users create, organize, and manage their notes efficiently. It supports features such as creating, editing, deleting, and archiving notes, as well as searching and tagging. The design also includes customization options like **color themes** and **font themes**, making it both functional and user‑friendly.  

This project is based on a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/note-taking-web-app-773r7bUfOG), which provides a professional layout you can adapt and extend into a full‑stack MERN application.

---

### Business Goals

- Deliver a **modern, intuitive platform** for note‑taking and organization.  
- Provide **customization options** (themes, fonts) to improve user experience.  
- Differentiate with **AI‑powered features**, such as smart summaries of notes and intelligent task suggestions.  
- Support both **end‑users** (who create and manage notes) and **administrators** (who oversee accounts, permissions, and system health).  

---

### Target Users
1. **Individual users** who want to keep personal notes organized and accessible.  
2. **Students and professionals** who need to manage study notes, tasks, or meeting records.  
3. **Administrators** who manage user accounts and monitor system usage.  

---

### Development Phases (aligned with sprints)

- **Sprint 1**: Create a **Figma prototype** and write **user stories**. See [course materials](https://github.com/tx00-web-en/Project/blob/main/material/sprint1.md) for detailed deliverables.

- **Sprint 2**: Build the **UI** (adapting the provided layout) and implement **basic backend functionality** such as CRUD operations for notes.  
- **Sprint 3**: Add **user administration**, integrate **LLM features**, and perform **testing**.  

---

### You Don’t Start from Scratch
To reduce stress around UI design, you are not expected to design everything yourself. Instead, you can **adapt the provided layout**:

> You may look at existing solutions for inspiration, but you must **clearly document** what you reused and what you modified. You will also need to extend the layout with additional views and an **LLM interface**, so your final product will go beyond the starter design.

---

### How This Can Be Used as a Full‑Stack Project
Although the challenge begins as a front‑end design, you will transform it into a **full‑stack MERN application** by adding functionality such as:

- **User accounts and authentication** (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js)  
- **CRUD operations** for notes (create, read, update, delete) with persistent storage in MongoDB  
- **Search and tagging** features to organize notes effectively  
- **LLM integration**:  
  - Generate AI‑based summaries of notes  
  - Suggest related tags or categories automatically  
  - Provide an AI assistant to answer questions about stored notes  
- **Admin dashboard** for managing users and monitoring activity  

---

### Workload Distribution
To ensure balanced contributions, each group should assign roles clearly:  
- **One or two members** focusing on **UI/UX** (adapting the layout, ensuring usability). This includes **Figma prototyping** in Sprint 1.  
- **One or two members** focusing on **backend development** (Express APIs, MongoDB integration, LLM calls).  
- Remaining members supporting **frontend logic, testing, and deployment**.  

---

### Final Product Expectations
By the end of development, the Note‑taking Web App should be a **full‑stack MERN application** with the following:

- **Frontend (React)**  
  - Clean, responsive UI for creating, editing, and managing notes.  
  - User dashboard with search, tags, and customization options.  

- **Backend (Node + Express)**  
  - Secure APIs for authentication, note management, and AI requests.  
  - Integration with an **LLM API** to provide smart features (summaries, suggestions, Q&A).  

- **Database (MongoDB)**  
  - Store user profiles, notes, tags, and activity logs.  
Perfect — here’s a **ready‑to‑hand‑out teacher brief** for the **Note‑taking Web App** project, written in the same polished, neutral “client brief” style as the Fylo one. You can give this directly to your students:
