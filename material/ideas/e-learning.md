# E‑Learning Platform

> [!NOTE]  
> Note: The following project is provided as a suggested starting point. Your group may choose to use it as‑is, adapt and extend it, or take inspiration from it to create something entirely new. It is meant to support your brainstorming process, not to limit your creativity.

### About the Project

This project is based on the [Skilled E‑Learning Landing Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/skilled-elearning-landing-page-S1ObDrZ8q) from Frontend Mentor. The original challenge provides a professional landing page design for a fictional online learning platform. It includes a hero section, course highlights, and a call‑to‑action area. You will adapt this layout and extend it into a **full‑stack MERN application** that supports dynamic course content, user accounts, and AI‑powered features.

---

### Business Goals

- Deliver a **platfoem** that promotes online learning opportunities.  
- Provide **dynamic course listings** and personalized recommendations.  
- Differentiate with **AI‑powered features**, such as course suggestions, learning path generation, and smart summaries of course content.  
- Support both **learners** (who browse and enroll in courses) and **administrators** (who manage courses, users, and system health).  

---

### Target Users

1. **Learners** who want to explore and enroll in online courses.  
2. **Instructors** who want to publish and manage their courses.  
3. **Administrators** who manage user accounts, oversee course content, and monitor platform performance.  

---

### Development Phases (aligned with sprints)

- **Sprint 1**: Create a **Figma prototype** and write **user stories**. See [course materials](https://github.com/tx00-web-en/Project/blob/main/material/sprint1.md) for detailed deliverables.
- **Sprint 2**: Build the **UI** (adapting the provided layout) and implement **basic backend functionality** such as course CRUD operations.  
- **Sprint 3**: Add **user administration**, integrate **LLM features** (recommendations, summaries, learning paths), and perform **testing**.

### You Don’t Start from Scratch

To reduce stress around UI design, you are not expected to design everything yourself. Instead, you can **adapt the provided layout**:

- Challenge link: [Skilled E‑Learning Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/skilled-elearning-landing-page-S1ObDrZ8q)  

> You may look at existing solutions for inspiration, but you must **clearly document** what you reused and what you modified. You will also need to extend the layout with additional views (e.g., course dashboard, enrollment flow) and an **LLM interface**, so your final product will go beyond the starter design.

---

### How This Can Be Used as a Full‑Stack Project

Although the challenge begins as a static landing page, you will transform it into a **full‑stack MERN application** by adding functionality such as:

- **User accounts and authentication** (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js)  
- **Course management** (create, edit, delete, and display courses dynamically)  
- **Enrollment system** for learners to join courses  
- **LLM integration**:  
  - Generate AI‑based summaries of course descriptions  
  - Suggest personalized learning paths for users  
  - Provide an AI assistant to answer course‑related questions  
- **Admin dashboard** for managing users, courses, and analytics  

---

### Workload Distribution

To ensure balanced contributions, each group should assign roles clearly e.g **One or two members** focusing on **UI/UX** (adapting the layout, ensuring usability). This includes **Figma prototyping** in Sprint 1.  

This division ensures that design, prototyping, and technical implementation all progress in parallel.
