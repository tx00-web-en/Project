# Bookmarks

> [!NOTE]  
> Note: The following project is provided as a suggested starting point. Your group may choose to use it as‑is, adapt and extend it, or take inspiration from it to create something entirely new. It is meant to support your brainstorming process, not to limit your creativity.
 
### About the Project

This project is based on the [Bookmark Landing Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-landing-page-5d0b588a9edda32581d29158) from Frontend Mentor. The original challenge provides a professional landing page design for a fictional bookmarking service. It includes interactive elements such as tabbed features, an FAQ accordion, and a newsletter signup form. You will adapt this layout and extend it into a **full‑stack MERN application** with persistent data, user accounts, and AI‑powered enhancements.

For reference only, you may also look at [Brad Traversy’s Tailwind solution](https://github.com/bradtraversy/tailwind-course-projects/tree/main/website-projects/bookmark).

### Business Goals

- Provide **user accounts** so individuals can save, organize, and manage their bookmarks.  
- Differentiate with **AI‑powered features**, such as smart bookmark categorization, content previews, and personalized recommendations.  
- Support both **end‑users** (who save and manage bookmarks) and **administrators** (who oversee accounts, content, and system health).  

---

### Target Users

1. **Individual users** who want to save and organize personal or professional bookmarks.  
2. **Students and professionals** who need to manage research links and resources.  
3. **Administrators** who manage user accounts and monitor system usage.  

---

### Development Phases (aligned with sprints)

- **Sprint 1**: Create a **Figma prototype** and write **user stories**. See [course materials](https://github.com/tx00-web-en/Project/blob/main/material/sprint1.md) for detailed deliverables.
- **Sprint 2**: Build the **UI** (adapting the provided layout) and implement **basic backend functionality** such as bookmark CRUD operations.  
- **Sprint 3**: Add **user administration**, integrate **LLM features** (categorization, previews, recommendations), and perform **testing**.

### You Don’t Start from Scratch

To reduce stress around UI design, you are not expected to design everything yourself. Instead, you can **adapt the provided layout**:

- Challenge link: [Bookmark Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-landing-page-5d0b588a9edda32581d29158)  
- Example solution for reference only: [Brad Traversy’s Tailwind version](https://github.com/bradtraversy/tailwind-course-projects/tree/main/website-projects/bookmark)  

> You may look at existing solutions for inspiration, but you must **clearly document** what you reused and what you modified. You will also need to extend the layout with additional views (e.g., bookmark manager, dashboard) and an **LLM interface**, so your final product will go beyond the starter design.

---

### How This Can Be Used as a Full‑Stack Project

Although the challenge begins as a static landing page, you will transform it into a **full‑stack MERN application** by adding functionality such as:

- **User accounts and authentication** (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js)  
- **Bookmark management** (create, edit, delete, and organize bookmarks)  
- **Search and tagging** features for organizing saved links  
- **LLM integration**:  
  - Generate AI‑based summaries of bookmarked pages  
  - Suggest categories or tags automatically  
  - Provide personalized recommendations based on saved content  
- **Admin dashboard** for managing users, monitoring system health, and viewing analytics  

---

### Workload Distribution

To ensure balanced contributions, each group should assign roles clearly:  
- **One or two members** focusing on **UI/UX** (adapting the layout, ensuring usability). This includes **Figma prototyping** in Sprint 1.  
- **One or two members** focusing on **backend development** (Express APIs, MongoDB integration, LLM calls).  
- Remaining members supporting **frontend logic, testing, and deployment**.
