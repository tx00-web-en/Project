# URL Shortening API Landing Page

> [!NOTE]  
> Note: The following project is provided as a suggested starting point. Your group may choose to use it as‑is, adapt and extend it, or take inspiration from it to create something entirely new. It is meant to support your brainstorming process, not to limit your creativity.

### About the Project

This project is based on the [URL Shortening API Landing Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G) from Frontend Mentor. The original challenge provides a professional landing page design where users can shorten links using an external API and manage them in the browser. You will adapt this layout and extend it into a **full‑stack MERN application** with persistent storage, user accounts, and AI‑powered enhancements.

For reference only, you may also look at [Brad Traversy’s Tailwind solution](https://github.com/bradtraversy/tailwind-course-projects/tree/main/website-projects/shortly).

### Business Goals
  
- Provide **persistent link management** so users can save, copy, and revisit shortened URLs.  
- Differentiate with **AI‑powered features**, such as link categorization, smart previews, and usage insights.  
- Support both **end‑users** (who shorten and manage links) and **administrators** (who oversee accounts, analytics, and system health).  

---

### Target Users

1. **Individual users** who want to shorten and manage personal or professional links.  
2. **Content creators and marketers** who need to track and organize multiple links.  
3. **Administrators** who manage user accounts and monitor system usage.  

---

### Development Phases (aligned with sprints)

- **Sprint 1**: Create a **Figma prototype** and write **user stories**. See [course materials](https://github.com/tx00-web-en/Project/blob/main/material/sprint1.md) for detailed deliverables.
- **Sprint 2**: Build the **UI** (adapting the provided layout) and implement **basic backend functionality** such as URL shortening and storage.  
- **Sprint 3**: Add **user administration**, integrate **LLM features** (categorization, previews, insights), and perform **testing**.

### You Don’t Start from Scratch

To reduce stress around UI design, you are not expected to design everything yourself. Instead, you can **adapt the provided layout**:

- Challenge link: [URL Shortening API Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G)  
- Example solution for reference only: [Brad Traversy’s Tailwind version](https://github.com/bradtraversy/tailwind-course-projects/tree/main/website-projects/shortly)  

> You may look at existing solutions for inspiration, but you must **clearly document** what you reused and what you modified. You will also need to extend the layout with additional views (e.g., user dashboard, analytics) and an **LLM interface**, so your final product will go beyond the starter design.

---

### How This Can Be Used as a Full‑Stack Project

Although the challenge begins as a front‑end landing page, you will transform it into a **full‑stack MERN application** by adding functionality such as:

- **User accounts and authentication** (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js)  
- **Persistent link management** (store shortened links, tags, and usage data in MongoDB)  
- **Integration with a URL shortening API** (e.g., Clean URI or similar)  
- **LLM integration**:  
  - Generate AI‑based link previews or summaries of the target page  
  - Suggest categories or tags for saved links  
  - Provide insights into link usage patterns  
- **Admin dashboard** for managing users, monitoring system health, and viewing analytics

### Workload Distribution

To ensure balanced contributions, each group should assign roles clearly e.g **One or two members** focusing on **UI/UX** (adapting the layout, ensuring usability). This includes **Figma prototyping** in Sprint 1.  

This division ensures that design, prototyping, and technical implementation all progress in parallel.
