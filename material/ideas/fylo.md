# Fylo

> [!NOTE]  
> Note: The following project is provided as a suggested starting point. Your group may choose to use it as‑is, adapt and extend it, or take inspiration from it to create something entirely new. It is meant to support your brainstorming process, not to limit your creativity.

### About Fylo

Fylo is a **cloud‑based storage and collaboration company**. It provides individuals and small businesses with secure online storage, easy file sharing, and real‑time collaboration tools. The mission of Fylo is to make it simple for users to store, organize, and access their files from anywhere, while also offering intelligent features that improve productivity.

---

### Business Goals

- Deliver a **modern, trustworthy platform** for file storage and sharing.  
- Provide a **smooth and consistent user experience** across devices.  
- Differentiate the product with **AI‑powered features** such as smart summaries of documents, suggested folder structures, and an intelligent FAQ assistant.  
- Support both **end‑users** (who upload and manage files) and **administrators** (who oversee accounts, permissions, and system health).  

---

### Target Users

1. **Individual users** who want to store personal files securely and access them on the go.  
2. **Small teams and freelancers** who need to share documents and collaborate.  
3. **Administrators** who manage user accounts, monitor usage, and ensure compliance.  

---

### Development Phases (aligned with sprints)

- **Sprint 1**: Create a **Figma prototype** and write **user stories**. See [course materials](https://github.com/tx00-web-en/Project/blob/main/material/sprint1.md) for detailed deliverables.
- **Sprint 2**: Build the **UI** (adapting the provided layout) and implement **basic backend functionality**. (See course materials for detailed deliverables.)  
- **Sprint 3**: Add **user administration**, integrate **LLM features**, and perform **testing**. (See course materials for detailed deliverables.)

### You Don’t Start from Scratch

To reduce stress around UI design, you are not expected to design everything yourself. Instead, you can **adapt the provided layout**:

- Challenge link: [Fylo Landing Page with Two Column Layout](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-landing-page-with-two-column-layout-5ca5ef041e82137ec91a50f5)  
- Example solution for reference only: [Brad Traversy’s Tailwind version](https://github.com/bradtraversy/tailwind-course-projects/tree/main/website-projects/fylo)  

> You may look at existing solutions for inspiration, but you must **clearly document** what you reused and what you modified. You will also need to extend the layout with additional views and an **LLM interface**, so your final product will go beyond the starter design.

### How Fylo Can Be Used as a Full‑Stack Project

Although Fylo starts as a static landing page, you will transform it into a **full‑stack MERN application** by adding functionality such as:

- **User accounts and authentication** (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js)  
- **File upload and storage simulation** (storing metadata in MongoDB, mock file handling)  
- **LLM integration**:  
  - Generate AI‑based summaries of uploaded documents  
  - Provide an AI assistant to answer user questions about their stored files  
  - Suggest improved marketing copy for the landing page sections  
- **Admin dashboard** for managing users, testimonials, or content  

This ensures the project evolves from a simple landing page into a dynamic, interactive application with real backend logic and AI features.

---

### Workload Distribution

To ensure balanced contributions, each group should assign roles clearly e.g **One or two members** focusing on **UI/UX** (adapting the layout, ensuring usability). This includes **Figma prototyping** in Sprint 1.  

This division ensures that design, prototyping, and technical implementation all progress in parallel.
