# Fitness Tracking App with Workout Plans

> [!NOTE]  
> Note: The following project is provided as a suggested starting point. Your group may choose to use it as‑is, adapt and extend it, or take inspiration from it to create something entirely new. It is meant to support your brainstorming process, not to limit your creativity.

### About the Project

This project is inspired by the [Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/body-mass-index-calculator-brrBkfSz1T) from Frontend Mentor. The original challenge provides a clean, responsive design for calculating BMI based on user input. You will adapt this layout and extend it into a **comprehensive fitness tracking application** with workout routines, progress tracking, and goal‑setting features.  

The BMI calculator serves as a **starting point** for the health metrics portion of the app, but your final product will go far beyond it.

### Business Goals

- Deliver a **modern, responsive fitness platform** that helps users track their health and workouts.  
- Provide **personalized workout plans** and progress tracking.  
- Differentiate with **AI‑powered features**, such as smart workout recommendations, nutrition tips, and progress summaries.  
- Support both **end‑users** (who track their fitness journey) and **administrators** (who manage users, content, and system health).  

---

### Target Users

1. **Fitness enthusiasts** who want to track workouts, goals, and progress.  
2. **Beginners** who need guided workout routines and health insights.  
3. **Administrators/trainers** who manage user accounts, monitor progress, and provide content.  

---

### Development Phases (aligned with sprints)

- **Sprint 1**: Create a **Figma prototype** and write **user stories**. See [course materials](https://github.com/tx00-web-en/Project/blob/main/material/sprint1.md) for detailed deliverables.
- **Sprint 2**: Build the **UI** (adapting the BMI calculator layout) and implement **basic backend functionality** such as user registration and workout logging.  
- **Sprint 3**: Add **user administration**, integrate **LLM features** (recommendations, summaries, coaching tips), and perform **testing**.

### You Don’t Start from Scratch

To reduce stress around UI design, you are not expected to design everything yourself. Instead, you can **adapt the provided layout**:

- Challenge link: [Body Mass Index Calculator](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/body-mass-index-calculator-brrBkfSz1T)  

> You may look at existing solutions for inspiration, but you must **clearly document** what you reused and what you modified. You will also need to extend the layout with additional views (e.g., workout dashboard, progress charts, goal‑setting pages) and an **LLM interface**, so your final product will go beyond the starter design.

---

### How This Can Be Used as a Full‑Stack Project

Although the challenge begins as a BMI calculator, you will transform it into a **full‑stack MERN fitness tracking app** by adding functionality such as:

- **User accounts and authentication** (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js)  
- **Workout management** (create, edit, delete, and track workout routines)  
- **Progress tracking** with charts and history logs  
- **Goal setting** (weight goals, workout frequency, milestones)  
- **LLM integration**:  
  - Generate AI‑based workout recommendations  
  - Provide nutrition or recovery tips  
  - Summarize weekly progress in natural language  
- **Admin dashboard** for managing users, monitoring activity, and viewing analytics  

---

### Workload Distribution

To ensure balanced contributions, each group should assign roles clearly e.g **One or two members** focusing on **UI/UX** (adapting the layout, ensuring usability). This includes **Figma prototyping** in Sprint 1.  

This division ensures that design, prototyping, and technical implementation all progress in parallel.
