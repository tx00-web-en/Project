# Self-Assessment Template

Each member is expected to write a self-assessment about the code he/she contributed. Use the following template to guide your reflection.

---

## Self-Assessment  

- **Member name:** *write your name here*  
- **Contribution area:** *briefly describe what part of the project you worked on (e.g., frontend component, backend route, database schema, etc.)*

---

### 1. Functionality
- **Does the code meet the requirements?**
  - [ ] Does it implement all specified features you were responsible for?  
  - [ ] Are edge cases handled (e.g., invalid data, duplicates)?  
  - [ ] Are there any bugs or unexpected behaviors?  

- **Integration**
  - [ ] Does your code work correctly with other parts of the application?  
  - [ ] Are inputs and outputs managed appropriately?  

---

### 2. Code Quality
- **Readability**
  - [ ] Is your code easy to understand for other developers?  
  - [ ] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?  

- **Reusability**
  - [ ] Can your code or parts of it be reused elsewhere in the application?  
  - [ ] Is logic modular and separated from unrelated concerns?  

- **Comments and Documentation**
  - [ ] Are there comments explaining complex logic?  
  - [ ] Is there documentation for how to use your code unit?  

---

### 3. Performance
- **Efficiency**
  - [ ] Are there any unnecessary operations or performance bottlenecks?  
  - [ ] Is the code optimized for larger datasets or high traffic (if applicable)?  

---

### 4. Overall Assessment
