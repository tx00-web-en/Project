## Considerations

> Suggested Workflow for Weeks 3, 4, and the Start of Week 5:

#### Week 3/4:

**Sprint Planning**

**Front-End:**

- Create the main components for your application and apply the appropriate styles.
- Ensure that all pages are responsive to provide a seamless user experience across different devices. You may use vanilla CSS or any CSS libraries. Refer to the links below for more resources.
- If your application is based on an existing HTML template, convert it into React components following the steps used in the front-end pair programming activity:
  - **Step 1:** Use the "HTML to JSX" tool to convert your HTML pages into JSX. Access the tool here: [htmltojsx.com](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx).
  - **Step 2:** Develop static React components using the converted JSX. These components will form the foundation for your dynamic front-end.

**Back-End:**

- **Step 1:** Develop the necessary mock data, controllers, routers, and middleware for your application. This includes setting up your back-end structure and defining routes for different API endpoints. You can use [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) or tools like ChatGPT to generate mock data.
- **Step 2:** Test all API endpoints using Postman. Organize your API routes by creating collections in Postman. This step is critical for validating the functionality and correctness of your back-end processes.

#### Week 4/5:

**Front-End:**

- Focus on adding user registration and login forms.
- Implement routing to enable navigation between different components of your application.
- Design and create all necessary forms and routes for your application.

**Back-End:**

- Implement **endpoints** to handle **calls to the LLM (AI**).
- Enhance the data model to support data persistence with a database.

**Presentation:**

- Prepare a presentation summarizing your work for Sprint 2.
- Submit all deliverables to OMA.

## Assessment Criteria for Sprint 2 (Total: 100 Points)

Your group's performance for Sprint 2 will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Artifacts of Sprint 2 (50 Points)**
   - The quality and completeness of the artifacts produced during the sprint, including both the front-end and back-end code.
   - **Breakdown:**
     - Front-End Code: 25 Points
     - Back-End + AI related Code: 25 Points

2. **Adherence to Scrum Process (25 Points)**
   - How well your team followed the Scrum framework, including participation in daily stand-ups (Daily Scrum), the effectiveness of the sprint review, and the quality of insights from the sprint retrospective.
   - **Breakdown:**
     - Participation in Daily Scrums
     - Effectiveness of Sprint Review
     - Quality of Retrospective Insights

3. **Group Presentation (25 Points)**
   - The quality and delivery of the  10-12-minute group presentation. This includes clarity, how well progress is communicated, and team collaboration during the presentation.
   - **Breakdown:**
     - Clarity and Structure:
     - Coverage of Sprint Outcomes and Next Steps
     - Team Collaboration and Participation

4. **Alignment with Sprint 1 Prototype**
   - How closely the sprint outcomes align with the original prototype developed during Sprint 1, including both functionality and design elements.
   - **Breakdown:**
     - Functional Alignment
     - Design/Visual Alignment

### **Important Notes:**
- All team members are expected to contribute equally to this sprint. Unequal contributions may result in a penalty for any member who does not participate fully.
- Deliverables must be submitted on time; late submissions will also incur penalties.


### **Summary of Point Allocation:**
| **Criteria**                              | **Points** |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|

| **Total**                                  | **100 Points** |

### **Tips for Meeting the Criteria:**

- **Artifacts of Sprint 2**: Ensure your code is clean and efficient. Make sure the application is responsive and include self-assessment of your code.
  
- **Adherence to Scrum Process**: Consistently conduct daily scrums, hold meaningful sprint reviews, and provide actionable insights during retrospectives.

- **Member Contributions**: Document individual contributions clearly, ensuring evidence of collaboration and fair participation from all members (e.g., through commit history, sprint retrospectives, and self-assessments).

- **Group Presentation**: Present your progress clearly, identify any challenges, and outline the plan for the next sprint.

- **Timely Submission**: Meet deadlines, as timely delivery is crucial in Agile environments.

- **Alignment with Sprint 1 Prototype**: Make sure your sprint outcomes closely match the prototype in both functionality and design.
